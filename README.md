# Localized WPF App example

This is an example of a C# WPF application that is localized.

* Texts are put into resource (resx) files
* Numbers are formatted according to the locale
* Texts directly defined in XAML also uses resx files

MainWindow.xaml and MainWindow.xaml.cs are the main files that you'd want to look at in this example. They show how the resources are used in XAML and in C# code.
